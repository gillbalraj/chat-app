# chat-app
Chat-App is a Node-Js application built using socket.io package. Create a one-on-one chat or a group chat. Its easy and fantastic!

To run the application simply clone the repository and follow these steps:

1. Run the server.js file from your terminal. 
        - write "node server.js" and hit enter. 
2. If everything went well, a message stating "Listening to port 3000" will be prompt at terminal.
3. Open your favourite browser and write "http://localhost:3000/" on the address bar.
      - open a duplicate window and start exchanging the messages.
     
And thats how simple it is. Enjoy!
